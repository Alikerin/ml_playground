# Object detectionImplementation of two end-to-end object detection methods: - [YOLO (v1)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640).- [SSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) (with [Focal loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002)).They are trained on PASCAL VOC 2012, which can be found [here](https://pjreddie.com/projects/pascal-voc-dataset-mirror/). I used the JSON annotations which can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/coco-dataset/external/PASCAL_VOC.zip).
