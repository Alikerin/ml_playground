# CNN models

Implementation of common state of art CNN models. They are tested on the MNIST data set, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

The models are:

- [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) 
- [Inception V1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842)
- [MobileNet V1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861)
- [DenseNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993)
